Robustness to sensing faults, incidents and adversaries
Most algorithms assume complete, noise‑free observations. 
Bayesian critiques (BCT‑APLight) and risk‑averse formulations are still simulator‑bound and ignore cyber–physical adversaries.

Scalability beyond a few dozen intersections
Graph‑based or hierarchical methods plateau when the road network exceeds ~100 agents, partly due to synchronous updates and dense communication assumptions.

Multi‑objective optimisation & equity
Safety, emissions and fairness are often treated post‑hoc or with static weights. Dynamic, Pareto‑efficient or lexicographic approaches have not been fully explored.

Standardised, open benchmarks
Heterogeneous simulators, reward definitions and data splits hinder fair comparison. There is no widely accepted large‑scale benchmark with sensor noise, incidents and realistic driver models.

Research directions
1. City‑scale digital‑twin testbeds
Develop open, cloud‑hosted SUMO/CityFlow twins with injected sensor outages and weather events; support plug‑and‑play MARL via CTDE or federated learning.

2. Robust & risk‑aware MARL
Integrate Bayesian critics, distributional RL and adversarial training to bound worst‑case delay and ensure safe fallback policies.

3. Adaptive multi‑objective optimisation
Employ constrained MARL or Pareto front exploration to balance throughput, safety, emissions and fairness in real time; couple with equity metrics (e.g., tail‑waiting times).

4. Edge–cloud co‑training and transfer
Leverage lightweight GNN encoders on roadside units and periodic cloud updates; investigate transferable latent policies across cities via meta‑learning.

5. Cross‑modal & CAV integration
Extend observation spaces to include connected‑vehicle messages, pedestrian detectors and bike flows; explore mixed‑traffic coordination with hierarchical MARL.

6. Benchmarking consortium
Form an open consortium (academia + industry + cities) to release annotated datasets, baseline code (e.g., MACPF, FRAP, Felight) and unified metrics, accelerating reproducibility.
